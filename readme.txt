Basic python script made to retrieve the first form linked to a Typeform API key and create a CSV from the information within.

Takes one argument when running the script: the api key. Outputs the .csv as 'answers.csv' in the readme file.

Uses the 'responses' library, so if you don't have it you'll need to install it.
